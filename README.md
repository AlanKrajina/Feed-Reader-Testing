# Feed Reader Testing
Feed Reader Testing is the 4th project in Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

# Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
